## Introduction
In this vignette we obtain estimates for all women with package datasets. By default, functions utilize UNPD datasets.


```{r, message = FALSE}
library(fpemlocal)
```

1. [Fit models and obtain samples for all women](#fit) `fit_fp_c`
2. [Calculate point estimates for indicators](#results) `fpet_calculate_indicaotrs`
3. [Plot the  point estimates against the survey data](#plot) `plot_fp_c`


## <a name="fit"></a>
## 1. Fit models and obtain samples for all women
`fit_fp_c` is a wrapper function to run the one-country implementation of the family planning estimation model. Specify the division numeric code, the union status of women (denote all women with `“ALL”`), and the time frame.

```{r}
fitlist <- fit_fp_c(
  is_in_union = "ALL",
  division_numeric_code = 4,
  first_year = 1970,
  last_year = 2030
)
```

Obtaining results for all women entails running the in-union and not-in-union model.  In this case, `fit_fp_c` returns a named list of fits.
```{r}
fitlist %>% names
```

## <a name="results"></a>
## 2. Calculate point estimates for indicators
Calculate point estimates for family planning indicators with the function `calc_fp_c`.

`calc_fp_c` utilizes `pmap` from the tidyverse package purr allowing it to act on any number of fits. We will supply the entire list of fits from `fit_fp_c`.
```{r}
resultlist <- calc_fp_c(fitlist)
```

Like the previous function, `calc_fp_c` returns a list. Since we supplied three fits the function returns three sets of calculated family planning indicators.
```{r}
resultlist %>% names
```

A set of results here consist of the following family planning indicators
```{r}
resultlist$ALL %>% names
```

The point estimates for each indicator are long-format tibbles. Let's take a look at the tibble for the indicator `contraceptive_use_modern`
```{r}
resultlist$ALL$contraceptive_use_modern
```

## <a name="plot"></a>
## 3. Plot the  point estimates and the survey data
fpemlocal also includes a function named `plot_fp_c` to plot the calculated point estimates against the survey data. The arguments to this function are, the fit object from step 1, the results from step 2, and a vector of indicator names. The vector of indicator names corresponds to the names which appear in the results from step 2. This function also handles lists.

```{r}
plot_fp_c(
  fitlist,
  resultlist,
  indicators = c(
    "unmet_need_any",
    "contraceptive_use_modern",
    "contraceptive_use_traditional",
    "contraceptive_use_any"
    )
  )
```
