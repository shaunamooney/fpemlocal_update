## Introduction
In this vignette we obtain estimates for married women with package datasets. By default, functions utilize UNPD datasets.

1. [Fit a one country model](#fit) `fit_fp_c`
2. [Calculate point estimates for indicators](#results) `calc_fp_c`
3. [Plot the  point estimates against the survey data](#plot) `plot_fp_c`

## <a name="fit"></a>
## 1. Fit a one country model
First, find the UNPD country code under the variable `division_numeric_code` in the dataset `divisions`. See `?divisions` for the metadata.
```{r}
divisions %>%
  dplyr::filter(name_country == "Afghanistan")
```

Fit the one-country family planning estimation model with the function `fit_fp_c`. First, supply the UNPD country code to the argument `division_numeric_code`. There are two versions of this model, one for in-union women and another for not-in-union women denoted `"Y"` and `"N"` respectively. Specify the model of your choice with the argument `is_in_union`. By default, the function `fit_fp_c` utilizes the UNPD contraceptive use survey dataset, `contraceptive_use` and filters the dataset based on the aforementioned function arguments. Lastly, specify the years of estimates to be returned. Note: year arguments will not filter the supplied survey data. All years of available survey data will be used.
```{r}
fit <- fit_fp_c(
  division_numeric_code = 4,
  is_in_union = "Y",
  first_year = 1970,
  last_year = 2030
)
```

## 2. Calculate point estimates for indicators
Calculate point estimates for family planning indicators with the function `calc_fp_c`. Supply the fit object from `fit_fp_c`. By default, the function `calc_fp_C` utilizes the UNPD population dataset, `population_counts` to calculate count variables such as the number of women using modern contraceptives.
```{r}
results <- calc_fp_c(fit)
```

A set of results here consist of the following family planning indicators
```{r}
results$Y %>% names
```

```{r}
results$Y
```

The point estimates for each indicator are long-format tibbles. Let's take a look at the tibble for the indicator `contraceptive_use_modern`
```{r}
results$Y$contraceptive_use_modern
```


## <a name="plot"></a>
## 3. Plot estimates and survey data
fpemlocal also includes a function named `plot_fp_c` to plot the calculated point estimates against the survey data. The arguments to this function are, the fit object from step 1, the results from step 2, and a vector of indicator names. The vector of indicator names corresponds to the names which appear in the results from step 2.
```{r}
plot_fp_c(
  fit,
  results,
  indicators = c(
    "unmet_need_any",
    "contraceptive_use_modern",
    "contraceptive_use_traditional",
    "contraceptive_use_any"
    )
  )

```
